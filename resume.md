## Experience
<div className="vertical-spacer"></div>

### DevOps Engineer | Falah Inovasi Teknologi<span class="spacer"></span>Sep 2024 - Dec 2025

*Fulltime* <span class="spacer"></span> GitLab | Bare Metal | Docker | Kubernetes | Grafana | Ansible | GitOps

- Managed multiple bare-metal Kubernetes clusters for internal and client-facing applications (simulation systems, VR platforms, backend services, frontend), including provisioning, node maintenance, storage, networking, and upgrades.
- Designed and maintained CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI) for Unity-based applications, microservices, and frontend apps, resulting in faster and more consistent releases across development, staging, and production environments.
- Implemented centralized monitoring, logging, and alerting using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Alertmanager—enabling earlier detection of node failures, pod crashes, API latency spikes, and storage issues.
- Deployed and operated AI/ML inference services (Ollama, LLMs, embedding services, OCR, etc.) on Kubernetes, optimizing GPU/CPU resource requests, autoscaling, and model loading time.
- Applied GitOps with FluxCD to manage dozens of HelmRelease deployments, secrets, ingress configurations, and namespace-level applications—improving traceability and reducing configuration drift.
- Automated cluster operations using Ansible (node setup, package installation, service configuration, firewall, Docker/Containerd setup) to standardize server initialization.
- Implemented multi-tenant environment separation (per project/namespace) including Traefik ingress routing, TLS, PVC provisioning, and resource limits, increasing system stability in multi-project deployments.
- Conducted troubleshooting and incident response for production systems (Docker issues, container runtime errors, broken ingress routes, PVC failures, and cluster networking issues).
- Collaborated with development teams to optimize application containerization, reduce image size, and improve deployment reliability.

### DevOps Engineer | Evermos<span class="spacer"></span>Mar 2024 - Aug 2024

*Internship* <span class="spacer"></span> Jenkins | AWS | Docker | Kubernetes | Grafana | Terraform

- Supported daily DevOps operations for a fast-paced e-commerce engineering team, focusing on improving deployment reliability across multiple microservices.
- Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins (Freestyle & Declarative), enabling automated build–test–deploy flows for backend, frontend (Golang, Java) and mobile apps.
- Containerized internal services using Docker and deployed them on Kubernetes (EKS), improving environment consistency and reducing deployment-related issues.
- Assisted in managing AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM), including environment provisioning and cleanup for development and staging workloads.
- Improved deployment speed by optimizing Jenkins stages, parallelizing jobs, and implementing image caching—cutting average deployment time by 30–40%.
- Developed Terraform scripts to standardize provisioning of S3 buckets, IAM roles, and EKS worker node configurations, reducing manual setup time.
- Worked closely with backend and QA teams to troubleshoot build failures, environment inconsistencies, and deployment rollbacks in staging.
- Documented CI/CD pipelines, deployment steps, and infrastructure usage guidelines.
